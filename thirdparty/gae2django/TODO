Misc
  - Rework GAE ancestry (incl. key generation and relationsships).

User API
  - Get rid of CallableString, it causes too much troubles:
    - How to set it for UserProperty fields, they return a
      Django User model?
      --> http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/3011
    - somehow it's really ugly...

Database API
 - Cleanup API
 - GQL
 - Unittests
 - Implement datastore.Query
 - Finish classes in ext.db
 - Remove prints from GqlQuery
 - Improve support for ListProperty, e.g. it supports queries like
   'some_list = :1' where 1 is an object in some_list (see Rietveld:
   codereview.views._show_user --> reviewable by me).
 - ext.db.get(keys) missing.

Mail API
 - Unittests
 - Add email address validation
 - Attachments
