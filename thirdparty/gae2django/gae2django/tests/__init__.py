"""Loads all the _test.py files into the top level of the package.

This file is a hack around the fact that Django expects the tests "module" to
be a single tests.py file and cannot handle a tests package inside an
application.

All _test.py files inside this package are imported and any classes derived
from unittest.TestCase are then referenced from this file itself so that they
appear at the top level of the tests "module" that Django will import.
