This examples shows how to run Rietveld - the code review tool available
at http://codereview.appspot.com/.

Before you are able to run this example you need to obtain a recent version
of Rietveld. There are two ways to do this. Either set it up manually or
use the Makefile in this directory.


Using the Makefile
==================

Skip down to "Manual Setup" if you don't want to use the Makefile.

Just run

     make all

This will fetch a recent Django and Rietveld's sources directly from their
Subversion repositories. When it's finished run

    ./manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

and point your browser to that location.


Upgrading Rietveld on Django
============================

To upgrade your Rietveld on Django installation just do the following:

 * Have a look at the current Makefile. Remember the Rietveld revision
   (at the top of the Makefile) you're currently running.
 * Update the gae2django sources from the Subversion repository (svn
   up).
 * Have a look at examples/rietveld/UPDATES if you need to do manual
   database changes. You only have to do manual database changes if
   there are entries in that file for Rietveld revisions greater than
   the one you've remembered in the first step.


Manual Setup
============

First check out Rietveld from Subversion by running

     svn co http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/codereview
     svn co http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/static
     svn co http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/templates

Then modify your checked out version of Rietveld by applying all patches
in the patches directory.

Now set a few symbolic links to include the helper and Django by running

    ln -s ../../django .
    ln -s ../../gae2django .
    ln -s ../../manage.py .

Finally run

    ./manage.py syncdb

to initialize the example database.
