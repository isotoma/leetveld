"""Intra-region diff utilities.

Intra-region diff highlights the blocks of code which have been changed or
deleted within a region. So instead of highlighting the whole region marked as
changed, the user can see what exactly was changed within that region.

Terminology:
  'region' is a list of consecutive code lines.
  'word' is the unit of intra-region diff. Its definition is arbitrary based on
   what we think as to be a good unit of difference between two regions.
  'block' is a small section of code within a region. It can span multiple
  lines. There can be multiple non overlapping blocks within a region. A block
  can potentially span the whole region.

The blocks have two representations. One is of the format (offset1, offset2,
size) which is returned by the SequenceMatcher to indicate a match of
length 'size' starting at offset1 in the first/old line and starting at offset2
in the second/new line. We convert this representation to a pair of tuples i.e.
(offset1, size) and (offset2, size) for rendering each side of the diff
separately. This latter representation is also more efficient for doing
compaction of adjacent blocks which reduces the size of the HTML markup. See
CompactBlocks for more details.

SequenceMatcher always returns one special matching block at the end with
contents (len(line1), len(line2), 0). We retain this special block as it
simplifies for loops in rendering the last non-matching block. All functions
which deal with the sequence of blocks assume presence of the special block at
the end of the sequence and retain it.

  One diff can have multiple representations. Some times the diff returned by
  the difflib for similar text sections is different even within same region.
  For example if 2 already indented lines were indented with one additional
  space character, the difflib may return the non matching space character to
  be any of the already existing spaces. So one line may show non matching
  space character as the first space character and the second line may show it
  to be the last space character. This is sometimes confusing. This is the
  side effect of the new regular expression we are using in WordDiff for
  identifying indvidual words. This regular expression ('b') treats a sequence
  of punctuation and whitespace characters as individual characters. It has
  some visual advantages for showing a character level punctuation change as
  one character change rather than a group of character change.

  Making the normalization too generic can have performance implications. So
  this implementation of normalize blocks intends to handle only one case.
  Let's say S represents the space character and () marks a matching block.
  Then the normalize operation will do following:

     SSSS(SS)(ABCD) => SSSS(SS)(ABCD)
     (SS)SSSS(ABCD) => SSSS(SS)(ABCD)
