About this file
---------------

In this file you'll find changes you'll have to do manually if you
upgrade a gae2django version of Rietveld.

The revision numbers (e.g. r427 at the start of a line) refer to
Rietveld revision numbers, NOT gae2django revision. You'll find the
revision of Rietveld you are currently running at the top of
gae2django's Makefile for the Rietveld example.

Note: Changes for Rietveld versions < 427 (as of July 8th, 2009) are
not listed here. If something goes wrong it's usually a missing
database field.

Another note: Depending on the database system you're using to run
Rietveld on Django, you may need to modify the SQL statements listed
here.
